# Getting Started with the Data Entry App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run this App
- Download the git repository
- Open the folder in your terminal
- Run "npm install" to download NPM Modules
- Run "npm start" to run a local server of the Data Entry app

The project simulates a system that allows someone to enter multiple people into a database. To store the data it uses localStorage.

When a name is entered you are redirected to the a page that let's you view the data. You can delete information or go back to the main page to enter more information.

If you are on the form page and would like to jump to data, there is a button in the bottom right to do so.
